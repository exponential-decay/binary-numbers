binary-numbers
==============

Application to automatically update a Twitter profile picture with a dynamically created image. The code currently
makes use of the Python Imaging Library (PIL), now Pillow to create dynamic images and then push them to twitter daily. 

To get the complete app running for yourself I recommend the excellent http://www.pythonanywhere.com service for the daily
Cron task and amazing Python support that is letting me run PIL and the Python Twitter Tools API: http://mike.verdone.ca/twitter/

###Archive

The original image archive has been placed here: [Simple Palette Binary Numbers](https://github.com/exponential-decay/binary-numbers/tree/master/binary-numbers-original-images)

Since then the technique used has been drastically updated, with better colors, and has evolved two or three times. The full archive of these remains live here: http://exponentialdecay.pythonanywhere.com/

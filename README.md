binary-numbers
==============

Application to automatically update a Twitter profile picture with a dynamically created image. The code currently
makes use of the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to create dynamic images and then push them to twitter daily. 

It is hoped that I'll get some gallery API support in here too to archive the different pictures created daily, 
but this is just a first cut to ensure everything works ok.

To get the complete app running for yourself I recommend the excellent http://www.pythonanywhere.com service for the daily
Cron task and amazing Python support that is letting me run PIL and the Python Twitter Tools API: http://mike.verdone.ca/twitter/

###Archive

Until gallery support is whitelisted at pythonanywhere.com I currently archive each picture generated to my
pythonanywhere web page here: http://exponentialdecay.pythonanywhere.com/
